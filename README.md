# Overfitting & Underfitting

### Reasons for Overfitting
- Data used for training is not cleaned and contains noise (garbage values) in it
- The model has a high variance
- The size of the training dataset used is not enough
- The model is too complex

### Reasons for Underfitting
- Data used for training is not cleaned and contains noise (garbage values) in it
- The model has a high bias
- The size of the training dataset used is not enough
- The model is too simple
